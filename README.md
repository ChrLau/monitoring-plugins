# monitoring-plugins
Mostly monitoring check plugins for Nagios/Icinga found on the Internet and modified for my usage.
Sadly most plugins are not always 100% what you need or some have bugs in them, but no central repository (or even contact details of the author..) so you can't send your fixes "upstream".
Therefore this repo.

For details see the comments in each plugin.
